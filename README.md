Looping-skeletalviewer
======================

Loops through all recognised skeletons (up to 6) instead of using two all the time. Based on Microsoft Kinect SDK's code.
Created by Alejandro Moreno as part of the COMMIT project (thanks, I am just sharing).
No copyright infringment intended on the Kinect Microsoft SDK code. I do not know the actual copyright rules on sharing this code. Not intended for commercial applications.
